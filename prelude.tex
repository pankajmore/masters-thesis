This project would have never have even been started had it not been for my
thesis advisor Dr Amey Karkare's help and guidance. Right from the time we
were looking for ideas to when we finally had a concrete proposal in hand, his
support has been invaluable. He entertained all my crazy ideas, found which
ones had merit, and helped me build on them. I wouldn't have been able to do
this without him.

I'd like to thank my parents and the others in my life for being patient with
me, especially towards the final stretch of thesis completion when I wasn't at
my best socially.

The Racket community, at \texttt{\#racket} on Freenode IRC, helped me
understand some of the Racket syntax model's intricacies. That helped me avoid
dead ends both early on and towards the end.

Special thanks to Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research for taking the time
out to answer a few questions about Z3.
